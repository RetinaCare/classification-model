##  Project Overview
**RetinaCare Fusion DR Predictor** is an AI-powered diagnostic tool designed to **predict the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** by fusing retinal image features with patient clinical data.  

This system supports **early detection**, **risk assessment**, and **personalized follow-up recommendations**, empowering healthcare providers to make informed decisions. The ML model has been deployed both as a **standalone demo on Hugging Face** and integrated into a **full-stack web application** developed by the RetinaCare team for production use.

### ✨ Key Features
-  **Multimodal AI Analysis** - Combines retinal images with clinical data
-  **5-Class DR Severity Classification** - From No DR to Proliferative DR
-  **Intelligent Risk Assessment** - Evidence-based follow-up recommendations
-  **Dual Deployment** - Hugging Face demo + Full-stack web application
-  **Backend Integration** - Model API for seamless healthcare system integration
-  **Real-Time Predictions** - Instant analysis and results

---

##  Model Development Workflow

### 1. Problem Definition
The model classifies Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity into five categories:
- **No DR** - No visible signs of diabetic retinopathy
- **Mild NPDR** - Presence of microaneurysms only
- **Moderate NPDR** - More than just microaneurysms, but less than severe NPDR
- **Severe NPDR** - Extensive hemorrhages, venous beading, or IRMA
- **Proliferative DR (PDR)** - Growth of new blood vessels (highest risk of vision loss)

Additionally, the system provides **follow-up recommendations** based on predicted risk levels.

---

### 2. Data Sources
- **Image Data:** Retinal fundus images (preprocessed and resized to 224×224)  
- **Clinical Data:** Three key patient features:
  - HbA1c level (%)
  - Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)
  - Duration of Diabetes (years)

📂 **Dataset Used:** [EyePACS, APTOS & Messidor Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ascanipek/eyepacs-aptos-messidor-diabetic-retinopathy)

This combined dataset provides a diverse and comprehensive collection of retinal images suitable for building and validating DR severity models.

---

### 3. Image Feature Extraction
A **pretrained ResNet50** model from `torchvision` was utilized to extract deep image features:
- Uses pretrained ImageNet weights for transfer learning
- The final classification layer is removed to extract feature vectors
- The resulting feature vector per image is **2048-dimensional**
- Features are frozen and used as input to the fusion model

This approach leverages **transfer learning**, allowing the model to capture rich visual representations without retraining the full CNN.

---

### 4. Fusion Model Architecture
The model fuses **image** and **clinical** features into a single prediction pipeline:

```
[Retinal Image 224×224]
        ↓
   ResNet50 (frozen)
        ↓
[Image Features: 2048-d] ──→ Linear(2048→256) + ReLU
                                      ↓
[Clinical Features: 3-d] ──→ Linear(3→32) + ReLU
                                      ↓
                              Concatenate [288-d]
                                      ↓
                            Linear(288→128) + ReLU
                                      ↓
                            Linear(128→5) + Softmax
                                      ↓
                         [5 Class Probabilities]
```

**Architecture Details:**
- **Image Branch:** Linear(2048 → 256) + ReLU
- **Clinical Branch:** Linear(3 → 32) + ReLU  
- **Fusion Layer:** Linear(288 → 128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
- **Output Layer:** Linear(128 → 5)

**Training Configuration:**
- **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Model Size:** 2.2 MB (lightweight and efficient)

### 5. Risk Mapping & Clinical Recommendations
Based on predicted DR severity, the system provides evidence-based follow-up recommendations:

| DR Grade         | Risk Level | Follow-Up Recommendation                                      |
|------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| No DR            | Low        | Annual screening recommended. Maintain good glycemic control. |
| Mild NPDR        | Low        | Follow-up in 9-12 months. Monitor blood sugar and BP closely.|
| Moderate NPDR    | Moderate   | Follow-up in 6-9 months. Consider referral to ophthalmologist.|
| Severe NPDR      | High       | Follow-up in 3-4 months. Urgent ophthalmologist referral.    |
| Proliferative DR | Critical   | Immediate ophthalmologist referral required. High risk of vision loss.|

This ensures **clinical interpretability** and **real-world utility** of predictions.

##  How the Fusion DR Model Works

###  Step 1: Input Collection
The user provides two types of input:
-  **Retinal Fundus Image** (color photograph of the retina)
-  **Clinical Data**:
  - HbA1c level (4.0-15.0%)
  - Systolic Blood Pressure (80-200 mmHg)
  - Duration of Diabetes (0-50 years)

These inputs represent both visual and physiological indicators of diabetic retinopathy.

---

###  Step 2: Image Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
- The uploaded image is resized to **224×224 pixels**
- Normalized using **ImageNet statistics** (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
- Passed through **pretrained ResNet50** (frozen weights)
- Outputs a **2048-dimensional feature vector** capturing deep visual patterns

> This step uses **transfer learning** – leveraging a model trained on millions of images to extract meaningful features from medical images.

---

###  Step 3: Clinical Data Formatting
- The three clinical values are converted into a **tensor** of shape `[1, 3]`
- No normalization applied (used as-is)
- These features represent the patient's metabolic and cardiovascular health

---

###  Step 4: Feature Fusion
- **2048-d image features** → processed by Image Branch → **256-d**
- **3-d clinical features** → processed by Clinical Branch → **32-d**
- Concatenated into a **288-dimensional fused vector**
- This represents a holistic view: what the eye shows + what the body reports

---

###  Step 5: Prediction via Fusion Model
- The 288-d fused vector passes through fully connected layers
- Outputs a **5-class probability vector** via softmax
- Each value represents the likelihood of one DR grade

Example output:
```
No DR: 5%  |  Mild: 10%  |  Moderate: 70%  |  Severe: 10%  |  PDR: 5%
→ Prediction: Moderate NPDR (70% confidence)
```

---

###  Step 6: Risk Assessment & Recommendations
- The predicted class is mapped to a risk level
- Clinical follow-up recommendations are generated
- Results are displayed with confidence scores

---

###  Step 7: Output Display
The app displays:
-  **Predicted DR Severity** (e.g., Moderate NPDR)
-  **Confidence Score** (e.g., 70.0%)
-  **Probability Distribution** (bar chart of all 5 classes)
-  **Follow-Up Recommendation** (e.g., "Follow-up in 6-9 months")
- 🔬 **Clinical Input Summary** (HbA1c, BP, Duration)
